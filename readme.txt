== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. I have a question =
A. Since this is a free plugin, please ask all questions on the supoprt forum here on WordPress.org. We will try to respond to every question within 48 hours. 

= Q. How can I request a feature or encourage future development? =
A. Free plugins rely on user feedback. Therefore, the best thing you can do for us is to leave a review to encourage other users to try the plugin. The more users, the more likely newer features will be added. That's a very small thing to ask for in exchange for a FREE plugin.

= Q. Do you support X or Y tracking scripts? =
A. If your script is not supported, just let us know to give us a chance to reply. After all, it's a free plugin, but we will do our best to ensure all reputable services are supported. When asking for such, it would be nice to get a sample of the script so that we can see its structure.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Why do my scripts appear as text on the website? =
A. Please make sure to enclose your script within script tags - <<script>> Insert Script Here <</script>>.

= Q. Where are this plugin’s Settings located? =
A. After activating the plugin, you can click on settings link under the plugin name OR you can click the HFCM tab on the left side navigation. From there, you can add, edit, remove, and review code snippets.

= Q. How do I add code snippets to all my posts/pages? =
A. With the version 1.1.4 of the HFCM plugin, we have replaced the Specific Custom Post Types with the ability to add code to All Post Types which include posts, pages, attachments and custom post types.

= Q. I have a question =
A. Since this is a free plugin, please ask all questions on the support forum here on WordPress.org. We will try to respond to every question within 48 hours.

= Q. How can I request a feature or encourage future development? =
A. Free plugins rely on user feedback. Therefore, the best thing you can do for us is to leave a review to encourage others to try the plugin. The more users, the more likely newer features will be added. That's a very small thing to ask for in exchange for a FREE plugin.

= Q. Do you support X or Y tracking scripts? =
A. If your script is not supported, just let us know and we'll look into it immediately. We will do our best to ensure all reputable services are supported. When requesting support for a particular script, it would be nice to get a sample of the script so that we can see its structure.

= Q. What are the differences between HFCM Pro vs. Free?
A. The PRO version contains many more powerful features not available in the FREE version in addition to forthcoming features. See the [PRO vs FREE differences](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hfcm-pro-vs-free-differences.png).
